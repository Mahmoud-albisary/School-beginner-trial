# School-beginner-trial
first trial of making a basic project in which there is a database having tables of the names and the starting time of each parents meeting with each teacher (the school could add the names and the starting time) then using flask as a backend to get the data from the database in order to display it to the parents who are reserving the meetings before the parents reserve any places they should enter their username and password that is added also by the school. then each parent should reserve their a meeting with each teacher by checking a check box for the desired time with every teacher then the data is sent back to the school at another table specifying the parents and the starting times with every teacher
